            <h1 id="title">The Working Dead</h1>
            <p id="info">Finally, the apocalypse is amongst us! We've all been waiting to creatively smash in some zombie heads since Night of the Living Dead. No chainsaws or nail-studded bats for you, unfortunately -- you're stuck at work with only paper, scissors and rocks from the recent wreckage of your office space to defend yourself. Your nearly-undead colleague has access to the same. Will you be able to defeat your lurker co-worker and escape or will you join it and become THE WORKING DEAD? </br> 
            </br> Begin the brawl by making a selection below.
