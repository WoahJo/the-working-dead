# The Working Dead
*Finally, the apocalypse is amongst us! We've all been waiting to creatively smash in some zombie heads since Night of the Living Dead. No chainsaws or nail-studded bats for you, unfortunately -- you're stuck at work with only paper, scissors and your pet rock/only friend Steve to defend yourself. Your nearly-undead colleague has access to the same. Will you be able to defeat your lurker co-worker and escape the office or will you join it and become THE WORKING DEAD?*
